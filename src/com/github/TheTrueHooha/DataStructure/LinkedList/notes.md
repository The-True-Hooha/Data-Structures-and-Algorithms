Is a linear data structure where each individual elements can be stored as per memory availability.
You should note that the Linked List stores only similar elements. Similar data types, and these elements can be
accessed using a linear fashion only.

The Linked list is dynamic, insertion and deletion of elements is relatively easy. And the starting element or data is
generally termed the head.

### Application
- Is suitable in situations where memory is limited
- Applications where there's usually insertion and deletion


### Types
- Singly Linked list: There's a pointer that's always pointing to the first node. The node contains a data, and a link.
- Doubly Linked list: They are two pointers pointing to the first node.
- Circular Linked list: The last node in the circular linked list points to the first.
