Binary Tree is a type of data structure that is hierarchical, where the top most element 
is the rot tree, and the subsequent node can have at most 2 child nodes in the tree.
Elements here can't be accessed randomly by index.

### Applications
- Used in file system hierarchy
- // TODO


// TODO Traversal in binary tree

### Traversal
- In-order:
- Pre-order:
- Post-order:

### Advantages
- can represent data with some relating to each other
- insertion and search are much more efficient

### Disadvantages
- sorting is difficult to implement
- There's no room for much flexibility
