This repo was created to help me with improve on my problem-solving skills, data structures and algorithms.
I've curated a list for further reading and explanations to for better understanding.

I created a package for each question. But you can find data structure types in their respective packages.

And can be found on hackerrank or Leetcode or wherever, I'll add associated links.

Find here [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/?no-filter=true), 
and [Neetcode](neetcode.io) to get started. 

As much, by God's grace I'll add more solved problems, aor resources.

Aloha 💜❣
