In binary search tree, the left child of the parent node is always less than the parent node, while the right node is 
always greater. It follows this principle for further implementation of child nodes.
To insert, delete, and search elements is more efficient in the binary search tree than the binary tree.

### Applications
- Suitable for hierarchical data/elements
