A kind of data structure with a collection of vertices and edges, where vertices
represent data, and the edges represent relationship between the vertices.


### Types
- Directed and Undirected graphs
- Weighted and Unweighted graphs
- Connected and Unconnected graphs


### Representations
A graph can be represented in several forms. Most common of which is Adjacency matrix, and Adjacency list. With each
its pros and cons.


### Applications
- Used in computer networks for peer to peer
- Used with solving puzzles with only one solution
- Used in circuits to represent circuit points as nodes and wires as edges
- Used to represent flow control in computers


### Java Libraries for Graphs
- JGraphT
- Google Guava
- Apache Commons
- Sourceforge JUNG

### Algorithms
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Topological sort
- Kahn Algorithm
- Strongly connected component
- A*


### Advantages
- It allows for application of all related algorithms
- Organizing data
- Understanding complex problems through visualization


### Disadvantages
- Uses a lot of pointers which can be complex and hard to understand
- Large memory
- If the graph is represented with an adjacency matrix then it does not allow parallel edges and 
multiplication of the graph is also difficult.
